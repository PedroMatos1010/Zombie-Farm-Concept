# Zombie-Farm-Concept


**Status:** Concept Phase
**Platform:** Godot Engine (Planned)


## 📖 Overview
This repository documents the planning and mechanics for "Zombie Farm", a game concept that mixes **Farming Simulator** with **Tower Defense**.
The goal is to farm resources during the day and defend the base at night.


## 🗂️ Project Organization (Trello)
> **Note:** The planning boards shown below are in my native language (Portuguese). A translated summary of the core mechanics is provided below.

## ⚙️ Core Systems (Translated)
Here are the main mechanics detailed in the planning board:

### 🔄 The Day/Night Loop
* **Day:** Player plants seeds, waters crops, and repairs fences. (Safe Phase)
* **Night:** Zombies attack from procedural spawn points. (Combat Phase)

### 📈 Progression & Economy
* **Economy:** Selling crops grants gold to buy turrets and better seeds.
* **Progression:** Unlocking new tools and defensive structures.

### 🚧 Current Progress
* **In Progress:**
    * Player movement logic.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Trello:** For task management, brainstorming and feature breakdown.
* **Godot Engine:** Chosen for the prototype implementation.
